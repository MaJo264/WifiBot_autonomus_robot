# WifiBot_autonomus_robot

In this project, I implemented an autonomous navigation system for the Wifibot robot. The system leverages a combination of sensor data and computer vision to enable the robot to navigate complex environments without human intervention. Using ROS (Robot Operating System), I integrated a LiDAR sensor for obstacle detection, a camera for visual recognition, and an IMU for maintaining balance and orientation. I developed custom algorithms for path planning and obstacle avoidance, ensuring smooth and efficient navigation. The entire project is modular, allowing for easy updates and improvements in the future.
